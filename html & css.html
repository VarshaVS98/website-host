            <h2>Geospatial Data Portal to Store, Visualize, and Share the Laboratory Test Results</h2>
    
           <p>The Kerala Highway Research Institute (KHRI), working under the Kerala Public Works Department (PWD), has long been at the forefront of pioneering research and innovation within Kerala's infrastructure sector. The first step in infrastructure planning is to understand the soil conditions of the area. Using existing soil data from a nearby project can significantly save time and costs by eliminating the need for a new investigation. Since soil properties in neighboring areas are likely to be similar, this data provides a reliable baseline for understanding the general conditions, allowing the planning phase to begin faster. Additionally, knowing that the soil conditions are comparable helps standardize construction practices, reducing variability in methods and simplifying overall project management.</p>

            <p>To address this, the Kerala Highway Research Institute (KHRI), under PWD, proposes creating a Geodatabase to store authenticated soil data using Google Earth and open-source software QGIS. This system will streamline the collection, organization, and visualization of soil data from borehole samples, laboratory tests, and borelog images. By linking geotagged data to specific geographic locations, this Geodatabase will reduce redundancy and provide stakeholders with easy access to reliable, spatially-referenced soil data. This approach will enhance decision-making for road, building, and bridge projects, ensuring more efficient and effective management of soil investigation data.</p>

        <h2>Laboratory Test</h2>

        <p>The samples collected under the supervision of the Kerala Highway Research Institute (KHRI) are tested in the KHRI’s laboratory to assess their index and engineering properties, and the soil are classified based on their properties as per IS 1498/ASTM D 2487. The index property of soil gives the information to identify and classify the soil, based on their physical characteristics, whereas, the engineering properties of soil determines the behaviour of soil under specific loading and environmental conditions. Assessmnet of the engineering property includes the determination of shear strength parameters, permeability characteristics, consolidation properties, dynamic behaviour, etc. The laboratory test procedure as per the Indian Standard conducted on the soil are as follows;</p>
